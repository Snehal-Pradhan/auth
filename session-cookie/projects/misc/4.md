#### **4. Cookie-Based A/B Testing & Feature Flags**  
- **Problem:** Startups need per-user experiments without a DB lookup.  
- **Solution:**  
  - Store **A/B test group** in encrypted cookie (e.g., `{test: "new_ui", group: "B"}`).  
  - **Server-side validation** to prevent tampering.  
  - **TTL-based auto-cleanup** for expired tests.  
  - **Tech:** JWT-style payloads with server-side verification.
